MultiTag
========

Unity3D simple multiple tags implementation

Usage
------
Add `MultiTag` to objects to be tagged. It exposes a list called `TagsList`, simply fill this in using the inspector with the desired tags.
`TagsList` contains a couple static methods to find GameObjects "tagged" via `MultiTag`, with the option to specify multiple tags to search with.

Example
-------
The repository contains an interactive example scene (note: made in Unity 5, may not work in Unity 4) that shows basic usage, using the <kbd>0</kbd> and <kbd>1</kbd> keys to interact.
